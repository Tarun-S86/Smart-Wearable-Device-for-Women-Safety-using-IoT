# Smart-Wearable-Device-for-Women-Safety-using-IoT

This project is my final year project oin B.E.
The main objective of this project is to help increase the safety of women commuting alone.
Women Safety Device is developed using Internet of Things technology by using various sensors and modules.

Components list:
1. Arduino NANO (Microcontroller)
2. SIM800L (GSM)
3. NEO6M (GPSM)
4. Pulse sensor
5. Vibration sensor
6. Temperature sensor
7. Panic button

Working:
When the woman feels she is in danger she can choose to click the panic button which triggers the "Manual mechanism" and sends help message to the parents or guardian through sms with current location link (google maps).
The device is equipped with 3 sensors which keep measuring body vitals and if any 2 sensors are high then the message will be automatically sent without having to click the panic button.

Code:
Written in embedded c using Arduino IDE.
